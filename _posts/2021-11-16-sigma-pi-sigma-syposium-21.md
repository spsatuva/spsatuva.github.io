The Tenth Annual Undergraduate Physics Research Symposium was held on November 5, 2021 in the Rotunda Lower West Oval Room. Fifteen undergraduates - a new record - gave oral presentations of their physics and astronomy-related research at the event, and four undergraduates presented posters. Topics presented were as follows:

# Posters
- **Michael Bowler**: Shaping the neutron beam profile at the Nab experiment
- **Abby Hellman**: Developing Live Monitoring of Gas Electron Multiplier Detectors
- **Gracemarie Buehlmann**: Jet-Level Analysis of Simulated CMS Data for Machine
Learning Applications
- **William Musk**: GEANT4 Monte Carlo Study of Electron-Proton Spatial Correlations in
the Nab Detectors
