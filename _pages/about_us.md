# Who We Are

The Society of Physics Students at UVa is a group dedicated to the academic and personal enrichment of the physics majors at the University of Virginia. We have three focuses: social inclusion within our chapter, providing access to [research]( {{ site.baseurl }}/research ) and [academic resources]( {{ site.baseurl }}/courses ), and representing the voice of undergraduates in the UVA physics department.

Although this organization has members who are University of Virginia students and may have University employees associated or engaged in its activities and affairs, the organization is not a part of or an agency of the University. It is a separate and independent organization, which is responsible for and manages its own activities and affairs. The University does not direct, supervise or control the organization and is not responsible for the organization's contracts, acts or omissions.
