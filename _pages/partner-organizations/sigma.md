# About

**Sigma Pi Sigma** is the national honor society for physics. It is an organization of the American Institute of Physics, and a member of the Association of College Honor Societies. Founded in 1921, there are more than 90,000 historical members. Sigma Pi Sigma exists to honor outstanding scholarship in physics, to encourage interest in physics among students at all levels, to promote an attitude of service, and to provide a fellowship of persons who have excelled in physics. Election is a lifelong membership. Selection to Sigma Pi Sigma is determined by the faculty of the department based on academic merit. Students are typically inducted in the spring of their third year at the university.

# Annual Research Symposium

Sigma Pi Sigma hosts the annual Sigma Pi Sigma Research Symposium, typically held in the first few weeks of November, as an opportunity for physics and astronomy undergraduates to present their research in the form of a poster presentation or a short talk. There are cash prizes given to the top three posters and talks. Judges for the symposium are invited from the faculty of both departments.
