# About

The goal of **the National Society of Black Physicists at UVA** is to foster an environment that advocates for the scientific and professional well-being of Black students and professionals in physics and astronomy. We hope to achieve this by:
Developing and supporting efforts to increase opportunities and visibility for Black students interested in Physics, Astronomy, and other adjacent fields.
Promoting activities and programs that highlight and maximize the impact of the scientific contributions made by Black physicists and astronomers to the STEM community.
Increasing awareness, accessibility, and appreciation of physics and astronomy within the Black community at UVA, Charlottesville, and beyond.
