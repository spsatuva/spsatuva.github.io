# Mission Statement

We are a group of physics majors focused on community, public outreach, and academic excellence. We strive towards these initiatives by hosting weekly meetings often including talks from professors on 
various fields of physics, sponsoring social events throughout the year to promote fellowship among the UVA physics community, and by engaging in several outreach programs beyond grounds including but not
limited to working with students from local K-12 schools such as Charlottesville High School.
