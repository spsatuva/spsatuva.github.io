# Mission Statement

We are a group of physics majors focused on community, public outreach, and academic excellence. We strive towards these initiatives by hosting weekly meetings often including talks from professors on 
various fields of physics, sponsoring social events throughout the year to promote fellowship among the UVA physics community, and by engaging in several outreach programs beyond grounds including but not
limited to working with students from local K-12 schools such as Charlottesville High School.

Name: Shrinidhi Nadgouda
<br>
SPS Position: President
<br>
Major(s) / Minor(s): Electrical Engineering and Physics
<br>
Research Interests or Area of Physics you find the coolest: Optics and Instrumentation
<br>
Your favorite Class that you've taken at UVA and why: Electronics (ECE), I really enjoyed getting to experiment with different devices (op-amps, transistors, etc) and see how they worked, as well as their applications.

<br>
Name: Christian Guinto-Brody
<br>
SPS Position: Vice President
<br>
Major(s)/Minor(s): Physics B.S. with a Philosophy Minor
<br>
Research: Currently doing experimental high-energy physics, interested in how we can improve particle detection techniques with more precise timing and better calorimetry.
<br>
Favorite Class: My favorite physics class I've taken at UVA is "Quantum Physics II" because it applied everything I learned in Quantum Physics I and Modern Physics to very neat phenomena in the quantum realm. Though I've taken some great non-physics classes like "The Meaning of Life" in the philosophy department and "Intro to Composition" in the music department, both of which prompted me to think in more artistic ways and create original works.

<br>
Name: Laura Carnevale
SPS Position: President of Sigma Pi Sigma
<br>
Major(s): BS Astronomy/Physics & BA Philosophy
<br>
Research Interests: I'm currently doing research about the relation between mass, star formation rate, and metallicity of galaxies across different simulations of the universe & I'm interested in the evolution of stars and galaxies in general :)
<br>
Favorite Class: Greek Mythology because I've always been interested in it so learning about it more in depth was super fun + Intro Astrophysics 2 because Craig Sarazin >>>>

Name: Carter Patten
<br>
SPS Position: SPS Treasurer
<br>
Majors: BS Physics, BA Chemistry
<br>
Research Interests: High energy physics
<br>
Favorite Class: PHYS 2720: Problem Solving, since the professor did a great job of keeping the physics relevant to actual things while still introducing really interesting concepts (bonus points for bringing in a Tesla coil).
